# nugets-to-play-with
A list of NuGet packages that I want to try and test so that I can use them in production projects.

* [Polly](https://github.com/App-vNext/Polly)
* [Flurl](https://flurl.dev/) _Bye RestSharp (hopefully)_
* [Ben.Demystifier](https://github.com/benaadams/Ben.Demystifier) _already used in production, still needs more test scenarios_
* [Humanizr](https://github.com/Humanizr/Humanizer) _a very interesting library!_
* [Dapper](https://github.com/StackExchange/Dapper) _very used to EF mental model, Dapper requires a mental shift on my end_
* [FluentMediator](https://github.com/ivanpaulovich/FluentMediator) _I'm happy with Mediatr package worth a try_
* [Enums.NET](https://github.com/TylerBrinkley/Enums.NET) _GODSEND!_
* [MoreLinq](https://github.com/morelinq/MoreLINQ) _Have never need a library to extend LINQ methods. Just curious of it's benefits_
